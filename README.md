**Basalt** is a CSS theme for the SCP Foundation Wiki. Its aims are to introduce simple up-to-date layouts in place of those offered by outdated or overly-complex contemporary themes.

Basalt's codebase is located on the Wiki itself. It is an extension of **Bedrock** - a base theme hosted on this GitHub repository. Bedrock exists as the foundational structure for Basalt and other projects under the same umbrella. All of these projects collectively use the name Basalt.
