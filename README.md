<h1>Overview</h1>

**Basalt** is an alternative base visual theme for the SCP Wiki. Its aims are to introduce simple modern CSS layouts in place of those offered by outdated or overly-complex contemporary themes.

The Basalt theme is hosted on the Wiki itself, as an extension of **Bedrock** - a base theme stored in this repository. Bedrock exists as the foundational structure for Basalt and other theme projects under the same umbrella. All of these projects collectively use the name Basalt.
